These are two java classes implanting a Sudoku solver.

Note. There is no input mechanism the 3 puzzles are hardcoded in the code. It maybe useful to anyone looking for a quick and efficient easy to understand java implementation. 

Class Solver, uses ArrayList Objects to keep track of the guesses it makes. Each new guess is a new object of the ArrayList class, forming a List like structure. 

The code is well commented, follow the function guess(ArrayList obj) in Solver.

Summary of what it does:

1.Resolves the puzzles till no new cells can be determined.

2.Locates cells with least number of possibilities.

3.Cycles through the possibilities of that cell from step one.

4.If no possibility of that(nested) cell works, the retraces previous cell guess, and repeats recursively.
